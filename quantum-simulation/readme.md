**Quantum Platform**: Qiskit Aer Simulator  
**Interface**: Streamlit

## 🜂 Quantum Implementation

### Law Mapping to Quantum Operations

| Law | Quantum Implementation |
|-----|------------------------|
| **I. Dual Potential** | `conditioning_strength` modulates control rotations |
| **II. Directional Equilibrium** | Balance between restraint/expansion affects coherence |
| **III. Relational Emergence** | CZ gates create entanglement between actors |
| **IV. Embodied Witnessing** | Somatic resonance affects phase alignment via Rz gates |
| **V. Adaptive Coherence** | AC_sys determines final rotation amplitude |

### Key Quantum Features

- **Actors as Qubits**: Each conscious actor represented as a quantum bit
- **Relational Entanglement**: CZ gates create relational field connections
- **Non-Collapse Path**: Balanced actors enable transcendence through resonance
- **Fractal Dimension**: Measures system coherence complexity
