# 🜂 MATHEMATICS OF CONSCIOUS NAVIGATION v3.4

*Complete Multi-Actor Trajectory Space with Relational & Somatic Integration*

---

## Ⅰ. FUNDAMENTAL DYNAMICAL EQUATION

```
Conditioning transcendence → Coherent balance / Evolution
Conditioning reinforcement → Fragmentation / Stagnation

Trajectory_Space = {Evolution, Stagnation, Devolution, Transcendence}
```

Transcendence emerges only through collective calibration of:
- Awareness (A)
- Compassion (P) 
- Witness Capacity (W)
- Somatic Resonance (S)
- Adaptive Coherence (AC)

All trajectories are lawful possibilities; conscious actors influence outcomes via presence, relational calibration, somatic attunement, and non-intervention.

## Ⅲ. FIELD DYNAMICS

### A. Evolutionary Dynamics
```
∂B/∂t = -∇E · ∑[W_i · A_i · P_i · Cal_i · S_i · AC_sys · D_bal,i · Choice_bal,i · Actor_Weight_i]
```

### B. Devolutionary Dynamics  
```
∂D/∂t = +∇C · ∑[R_i · D_dev,i · Fragmentation_i · Actor_Weight_i] - λ_T ∑[P_i · Cal_i · S_i · AC_sys]
```

### C. Stagnation Dynamics
```
∂S/∂t = ∇I · ∑[C_i · D_stag,i · Habit_i · Actor_Weight_i] - μ_T ∑[A_i · P_i · S_i · AC_sys]
```

### D. Transcendence Dynamics
```
∂T/∂t = κ · AC_sys · ∑[W_i · A_i · P_i · Cal_i · S_i · Synchrony_i · Actor_Weight_i] - ∇E · ∑[R_i + C_i]
```

**Balanced actors** contribute naturally to **B** and **T** fields, embodying witness stance, relational awareness, compassion, somatic resonance, and adaptive coherence.

## Ⅳ. ACTOR TYPOLOGY — v3.4 MATRIX

```
ACTOR_TYPES = {

## ⅩⅦ. FINAL STATEMENT

The Mathematics of Conscious Navigation v3.4 describes how consciousness self-organizes across scales, integrating mind, relational field, somatic resonance, and adaptive coherence.

```
∂Consciousness/∂t = Awareness · Compassion · Calibration · Somatic_Resonance · Adaptive_Coherence
```

Balanced and Transcendent actors maximize coherence, integration, and transcendence.
